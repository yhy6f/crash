Traffic crashes in Columbia

-Raw STARS report data from Missouri State Highway Patrol in the folder "wholedataset". CSV spreadsheets with headers in "clean".

-I analyzed the data using SQL analysis and kept a journal of what I did: "Crash documentation". WARNING: it's super long and boring and detailed.

-Findings are in spreadsheets in folders that look like dates.

-I learned agate recently and have been trying to use it for analysis. See folder "agate".

-My other repo "crash_interactive" hosts the codes for visualization.
